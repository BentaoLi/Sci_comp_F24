-	Name, family, where you are from and where you live now
-	Major/program, year 
-	Computing and data analysis experience: what software or computing environments you have used, mathematical and statistical training, any data analysis experience

Go over syllabus in detail
Intro to slack, github, anaconda and datacamp

## Lab 1.1 (Due Tuesday by midnight):
1.	Join the class slack (https://join.slack.com/t/scicompf24/shared_invite/zt-2oxfl93z7-926B7Jv6w7eX8OMAjvArcw) and introduce yourself on the #introdcutions channel.
1.	Sign up for a github account. Choose your github username wisely. Send Dr. H your github username over slack so you can be added to our course github channel (https://github.com/chsharrison/Sci_comp_F24/)
1.	Join the class datacamp site: https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/58a2d9614aa92933a0f0602d1ac744ba902ca767a8094e19a0e95e7f63ed74e4. Navigate to the assignments page.

A portion of the below will need to be completed outside of lab time.

1.	Get Anaconda, the python interface, installed on your computer
    1.  Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download
    2.	Make sure you have Jupyter Lab (python notebooks), QT console (interactive or ipython), and Spyder installed
    3.	Go through the "getting started" resource for Anaconda https://freelearning.anaconda.cloud/get-started-with-anaconda
    4.	Get through "conda workflow"
    5.	When the whole class has this installed we will go over some basic conda commands together and making a new evironment 

2.	In datacamp, complete your first assignment: Introduction to Python, Ch 1 “Python Basics”
3.	Open ipython/QT console and run the four code examples in the last exercise in the datacamp “Introduction to Python” first chapter we did on Monday (“Can Python handle everything?”). Note that the ipython console is what the bottom datacamp interactive window uses.
    1.	Enter the same four code examples again both in Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook. Make sure you know how to execute code in each of these interfaces.
    2.	Play around with these different coding interfaces and practicing some of the code you learned in datacamp
6.	Turn in your work on Moodle submit screenshots of:
    1.	Your completed chapter on datacamp (including your score).
    2.	Your work on the ipython, jupyter notebook and spyder interfaces
