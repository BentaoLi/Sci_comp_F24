Intro to slack, github, anaconda and datacamp

## Lab 1.1 (Due Wednesday by midnight):
1.	Join the class slack (https://join.slack.com/t/scicompf24/shared_invite/zt-2oxfl93z7-926B7Jv6w7eX8OMAjvArcw) and introduce yourself on the #introdcutions channel.
1.	Sign up for a github account. Choose your github username wisely. Send Dr. H your github username over slack so you can be added to our course github channel (https://github.com/chsharrison/Sci_comp_F24/)
1.	Join the class datacamp site: https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/58a2d9614aa92933a0f0602d1ac744ba902ca767a8094e19a0e95e7f63ed74e4. Navigate to the assignments page.

    1.  Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download
    3.	Go through the "getting started" resource for Anaconda https://freelearning.anaconda.cloud/get-started-with-anaconda
    4.	Get through "conda workflow"
    5.	When the whole class has this installed we will go over some basic conda commands together and making a new evironment 

2.	In datacamp, complete your first assignment: Introduction to Python, Ch 1 “Python Basics”
3.	Open ipython/QT console and run the code examples in the last exercise in the datacamp “Introduction to Python” first chapter. Note that the ipython console is what the bottom datacamp interactive window uses.
    1.	Enter the same code examples again both in Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook. Make sure you know how to execute code in each of these interfaces.
    2.	Play around with these different coding interfaces and practicing some of the code you learned in datacamp
6.	Turn in your work on Moodle submit screenshots of:
    1.	Your completed chapter on datacamp (including your score).
